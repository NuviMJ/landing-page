                <p>Coachello has contractors and subsidiaries in other countries, including those outside the European Economic Area, who may have access to your personal data. At the same time, in all cases we pass your personal data to other persons we ensure that your personal data is being protected and used only within the purposes specified in this Privacy Policy. This is achieved by using only certified services and products, signing data processing agreements for protection of personal data with contractors and partners (including the Standard Data Protection Clauses Adopted by the European Commission and compliant with the EU data protection laws), as well as taking technical measures to ensure the information is protected when stored, used and while being processed and transferred.</p>
                <p>By ticking the respective box when providing us with your personal data you agree to such transfer and processing within the purposes set in this Privacy Policy.</p>
                <p><br /><strong>How long will the personal data be processed and stored by Coachello?</strong></p>
                <p>Your personal data will be stored by Coachello no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed.</p>
                <p>Generally, Coachello retains your personal data as long as your account is active. In case your account expires or you decide to delete your account, Coachello retains your personal data not longer than 90 days after the account is expired.</p>
                <p>However, in case of conflict situations in progress Coachello may store personal data for 180 days period or more if the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims and for compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing by Union or Member State law to which the controller is subject in case of an expired account or in case data subject requested to delete his personal data. Upon the expiry of this period or earlier, if a conflict situation is settled, all personal data gets deleted.</p>
                <p>In case your last activity on Coachello, as of the last payment date (of your employer), was more than 180 (one hundred eighty) days ago, your account will be considered expired and gets deleted. Along with your account or profile all personal data processed by Coachello will be erased.</p>
                <p>As you are entitled to delete your account or profile after such a request it will be permanently removed within 30 days or earlier from our active systems, servers and back-ups. By deleting your account or profile all your personal data will be removed as well within 90 days.</p>
                <p>Personal Data collected when you registered on our mailing list or for the newsletter will be stored as long as you are interested in receiving our emails. We consider that you&rsquo;re interested in this until you unsubscribe from the mailing list or from the newsletter by clicking the respective link contained in each of our emails.</p>
                <p>After the expiration of the retention period, Coachello shall terminate the processing of your personal data, unless otherwise set by the relevant legislation.</p>
                <p><br /><strong>Your rights as data subject regarding your personal data Coachello processes:</strong></p>
                <ol data-rte-list="default">
                    <li>
                        <p>right of confirmation - to obtain from Coachello the confirmation as to whether or not personal data concerning you is being processed;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>right of access to your personal data processed by Coachello;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>right to rectification &ndash; ask Coachello to have incomplete personal data requiring corrections completed;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>right to erasure (right to be forgotten) &ndash; request Coachello to erase personal data. In most cases Coachello will erase it unless otherwise required by legislation;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>right of restriction of processing. For example, you could contest the accuracy of your personal data or in case Coachello is not interested in processing of your personal data any longer, but you want Coachello to do this for different reasons, for example, to bring some claim for somebody and, instead of the erasure of information, its processing will be just restricted.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>right to data portability - to have your personal data transmitted directly from one controller to another, where technically feasible and when doing so does not adversely affect the rights and freedoms of others;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>right to object to processing of your personal data by Coachello when the processing is related to the performance of our task carried in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in us. The other case is if we process your data for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by us or by a third party and you believe that such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms. If you make a request with objection to processing, we will no longer process the personal data unless we are able to demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing;</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Right to withdraw consent at any time by contacting us. After we at Coachello receive such withdrawal request from you, we will process it in a timely manner and we will no longer process your personal data, unless otherwise set by law.</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>If one of the aforementioned reasons applies, please contact us, as instructed at the end of this Privacy Policy. We shall promptly ensure that the request is complied with immediately. These requests are free of charge.</p>
                <p>If you believe that our use of your data violates your rights, you can lodge a complaint with the competent data protection authority.</p>
                <p>Please, note that when the processing of your personal data is carried for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object at any time to such processing without providing any justification and we will no longer process your data with such direct marketing purposes.</p>
